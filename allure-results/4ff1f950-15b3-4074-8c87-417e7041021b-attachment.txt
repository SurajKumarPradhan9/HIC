🤖 AI FAILURE ANALYSIS
========================

**ROOT CAUSE:**  
The test failed because invalid input (`0/0`) was not handled correctly by the application. Instead of showing an error or staying on the input page, the application navigated to the result page, violating expected behavior.

**SOLUTION:**  
1. Update the application logic to validate inputs like `0/0` and prevent navigation to the result page for invalid data.  
2. Add proper error messages or input validation checks for invalid formats.  
3. Enhance the test to explicitly verify that invalid inputs trigger an error and do not proceed further.

**PREVENTION:**  
1. Implement comprehensive input validation at both the frontend and backend.  
2. Extend test coverage to include edge cases like invalid formats, division by zero, and negative values.  
3. Regularly review and update test data to include boundary and invalid cases.
