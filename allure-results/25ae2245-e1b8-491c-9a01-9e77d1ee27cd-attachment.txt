🤖 AI FAILURE ANALYSIS
========================

**ROOT CAUSE:**  
The test failed because invalid inputs (e.g., "140/60" and "Negative") were accepted, and the application navigated to the result page instead of displaying an error or blocking the operation. The validation logic for input fields appears to be missing or incorrectly implemented.

**SOLUTION:**  
1. Verify the application's input validation logic for all fields, ensuring it rejects invalid formats like "140/60" and values like "Negative."  
2. Update the application code to enforce stricter validation rules for these fields.  
3. Enhance the test to explicitly check for error messages or blocked navigation when invalid inputs are provided.

**PREVENTION:**  
1. Add boundary and negative test cases to validate input handling during development.  
2. Implement automated input validation checks in unit tests before integration testing.  
3. Regularly review input validation requirements and update tests accordingly.
