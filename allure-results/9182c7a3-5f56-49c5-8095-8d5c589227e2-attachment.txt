🤖 AI FAILURE ANALYSIS
========================

**ROOT CAUSE:**  
The test failed because invalid inputs (e.g., negative numbers and non-standard formats like "165/75") were not properly handled by the application. Instead of showing an error or staying on the input page, the application incorrectly navigated to the result page, violating the expected behavior.

**SOLUTION:**  
1. Update the application logic to validate inputs (e.g., reject negative numbers and non-numeric formats) before proceeding.  
2. Add error messages or validation feedback for invalid inputs.  
3. Enhance the test to explicitly verify that invalid inputs do not navigate to the result page and instead trigger appropriate error handling.

**PREVENTION:**  
1. Implement stricter input validation in the application and test for edge cases during development.  
2. Expand test coverage to include a variety of invalid input scenarios.  
3. Use data-driven testing to systematically test all invalid input combinations.
