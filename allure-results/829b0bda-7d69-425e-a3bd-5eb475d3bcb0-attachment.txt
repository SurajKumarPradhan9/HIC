🤖 AI FAILURE ANALYSIS
========================

**ROOT CAUSE:**  
The test failed because invalid inputs (e.g., "0" for Param 2 and "Negative" for Param 4/5) were not handled correctly by the application. Instead of showing an error or validation message, the application navigated to the result page, which violates expected behavior.

**SOLUTION:**  
1. Verify the application's input validation logic for edge cases like zero or negative values.  
2. Update the application to block invalid inputs and display appropriate error messages.  
3. Enhance the test to explicitly check for validation messages or error states when invalid inputs are provided.

**PREVENTION:**  
1. Add boundary and negative test cases to validate input handling during development.  
2. Implement stricter input validation at both frontend and backend levels.  
3. Regularly review and update test data to include edge cases and invalid scenarios.
